### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the parameter `2024`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that leap years occur every four years; however, years divisible by 100 and not by 400 are not leap years. The year 2024 is divisible by 4 and not by 100, making it a valid leap year. The test validates that the function adheres to these rules.

### Scenario 2: Test a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `2023`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 2023 is not divisible by 4, thus it is not a leap year. This test ensures that the function correctly applies this part of the leap year rule.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Test a year that is a century (i.e., divisible by 100) but not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `1900`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that while 1900 is divisible by 100, it is not divisible by 400, which is required for a century to be a leap year. This test checks the function's compliance with this more nuanced part of the leap year rule.

### Scenario 4: Test a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensure the function recognizes a century year that is also a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `2000`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 2000 is divisible by both 100 and 400, making it a leap year despite being a century. This test confirms that the function correctly handles this special case.

### Scenario 5: Test the minimum valid input
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_valid_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the smallest typical year input, which is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `1`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 1 is not divisible by 4, hence it is not a leap year. This test ensures that the function can handle edge cases at the lower end of the valid input spectrum without error.

### Scenario 6: Test a future typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_typical_leap_year
  Description: Ensure the function can correctly evaluate leap years in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with a future year, such as `2084`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that evaluating future years correctly is crucial for planning and calculations in various software contexts. The year 2084 follows the standard leap year rules, and this test ensures the function remains valid for future dates.

Each test scenario ensures that `judge_leap_year` adheres to the leap year rules, providing accurate results for both current and future planning applications in various software systems.
